# SCIF: Privacy-Preserving Statistics Collection with Input Validation and Full Security
This repository contains the SCIF prototype, built in Golang. SCIF is a practical private statistics system, consisting of clients, secure multiparty computation servers, and an output party (e.g., data analyst). It ensures that only well-formed client inputs, those satisfying a predefined predicate, are included in the final computation (e.g., sum). Even with a minority of malicious servers, the output party can still compute the final result. For more details, please [refer to our paper](#citation).

## Build & Run on Cloud Provider
The deployment and execution on Google Cloud are managed through ansible, and the source code of SCIF is under the tls_mal_mysql_new tag. Details are described in the following repository. https://github.com/GUSecLab/smc-in-a-box-ansible/tree/main

## Build & Run Manually
### 1. Building environment
   
   First, ensure that you have Go installed. 

   ```
   $ go version
   ```
   
   Second, ensure that MySQL is installed and running with a configured username and password for connections. The default credentials used in SetupDatabase() (located in store.go under server/sqlstore and outputparty/store) may need to be replaced with your own.

   ```
   $ mysql --version 
   ```

   If MySQL is installed, you’ll see a version number.

   ```
   $ brew services list
   ```

   If MySQL is running, it will be marked as started.

   
### 2. Prepare config file and input file
Each client, server, and output party requires both a config file and an input file before execution. Example configuration files can be found in the following locations:  

- **Client:** `client_template.json` within `smc-in-a-box/client/config` directory
- **Server:** `server_template.json` within `smc-in-a-box/server/config` directory
- **Output Party:** `outputparty_template.json` within `smc-in-a-box/outputparty/config` directory

Additionally, scripts for batch generation of config and input files are available in each party's `scripts/generator` directory.

Client Config Example
```

    "Client_ID": "c1",
    "Token": "tk1",

- ServerShareDue: Deadline for servers to submit aggregated shares to the output party.
- Owner: URL of the output party for servers to submit aggregated shares.

### 3. Run the software
Before starting any party, in the smc-in-a-box folder, run the following command line to ensure that all dependencies are properly fetched.
```
$ go mod tidy
```

To start a server, in the server/cmd folder, compile then run:
```
$ ./cmd -confpath="path_to_server_config_file" -inputpath="path_to_experiments_file" -logpath="path_to_log_folder" -n_client=num_of_clients
```

To start an output party, in the outputparty/cmd folder, compile then run:
```
$ ./cmd -confpath="path_to_output_party_config_file" -inputpath="path_to_experiments_file" -logpath="path_to_log_folder" -n_client=num_of_clients
```

To start a client, in the folder client/cmd, compile then run
```
$ ./cmd -confpath=“path_to_client_config_file” -inputpath=“path_to_input_file” -logpath="path_to_log_folder"
``` 

At the start of each party's run, a config file and input file will be generated. Debugging messages will scroll by in the terminal window. Once the computation is complete, the log file for each party and the final result file will be generated.

Parameter Descriptions:
- For server and output party: use -mode="http" to disable TLS; the default enables it (which requires setup of certificate).
- For server: use -n_client_mal=num_of_malicious_client to enable malicious clients; the default assumes all are honest.
- For client: use -mode=honest to run client without malicious behavior. Default setting assumes client could act maliciously.
   
 **Note:** Servers and the output party must start before clients.

The above commands are for running each party on different physical machines. To start a cluster of servers, an output party, and a cluster of clients (all on the same machine), use the source code with the local tag. Go to the local folder and run:
```
$ ./local
```
